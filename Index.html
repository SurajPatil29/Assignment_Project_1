                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Daredevil is the Man Without Fear! Blinded as a youngster by radioactive chemicals,
                    Matt Murdock soon found that his other senses had been heightened to extraordinary levels.
                    As an adult, he took on the mantle of Daredevil- the protector of the gritty New York neighborhood
                    Hell's Kitchen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blinded as a child in an accident that leaves his other senses enhanced to extraordinary levels,
                    Matt Murdock fights relentlessly for the law and justice,
                    both as a crusading attorney and as the hard-hitting costumed crimefighter called Daredevil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Daredevil is the alias of Matthew Michael "Matt" Murdock, a blind lawyer.
                    His origins stem from a childhood chemical accident that gave him special abilities.
                    While growing up in the historically gritty or crime-ridden working class Irish-American
                    neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen in New York City,
                    Matt Murdock is blinded by a radioactive substance that falls from an out-of-control truck after he
                    pushes a man out of the path of the oncoming vehicle.
                    While he can no longer see, his exposure to the radioactive material heightens his remaining senses
                    beyond normal human ability, and gives him a "radar sense."
                    His father, a boxer named Jack Murdock, is a single man raising his now blind son, who despite his
                    rough upbringing,
                    unconditionally loves his son and tries to teach him to form a better life for himself.
                    Jack is later killed by gangsters after refusing to throw a fight, leaving Matt an orphan.
                    To protect himself, Matt began training to hone his physical abilities and superhuman senses under
                    the tutelage of a mysterious blind stranger named Stick,
                    eventually becoming a highly skilled and expert martial artist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some years later, after graduating from law school with high grades, Matt seeks out the criminal
                    element in Hell's Kitchen and starts his crime-fighting activities.
                    Matt targets the local gangsters who murdered his father and succeeds in bringing them to justice.
                    Eventually, donning a costumed attire modeled after a devil,
                    Matt took up a dual life of fighting against the criminal underworld in New York City as the masked
                    vigilante Daredevil, which put him in conflict with many super-villains,
                    including his arch-enemies Bullseye and the Kingpin.[10] He also becomes a skilled and respected
                    lawyer after graduating from Columbia Law School with his best friend and roommate,
                    Franklin "Foggy" Nelson, with whom he becomes law partners, forming the law firm Nelson & Murdock.
                    After pretending to have a sighted identical twin brother named Mike Murdock,
                    who Matt would claim was Daredevil whenever his identity was made public knowledge, and occasionally
                    impersonate, Mike is brought into existence following an encounter with a reality-warping mutant,
                    before cementing his existence alongside Matt in history with a magic spell.
